### How To Use:

- Tap the screen on your phone once to select the beginning point.
- Tap the screen a second time to select the end point of the measurement.

### System Requirements:

Apple Phone or iPad with AR capabilities. This application cannot be used on desktop.

### Ponders:

This application was built in conjunction with another extended reality project I am currently working on. This is a small piece of a larger idea I am developing with my team. We came to discover near exact measurements can be taken within XR.
